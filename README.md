# Setup Linx Ubunthu Server 

Hi this is a little Tutorial to how to setup a Linx Ubunthu Server and the security.

## Requiremnts 

- A linux machine local or remote
- A computer for connect to the server

## Step 1: Update and Upgrade the System

```sh 
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y 
```

## Step 2: Generate a ssh key pair on client machine

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
or

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```
## Diffrence between RSA and Ed25519

### RSA:

- Based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
- Keys are larger (2048+ bits) for equivalent security.
- Slower for signing and verifying compared to modern algorithms.
- Common in legacy systems and applications requiring compatibility.
### Ed25519 (suggested):

- Based on elliptic curve cryptography (specifically Curve25519).
- Smaller keys (256 bits) with high security and performance.
- Much faster signing and verification.
- Designed for modern use cases, with a focus on efficiency and resistance to side-channel attacks.

## Step 3: Copy the public key to the server

```sh
scp ~/.ssh/keyid.pub username@server:~/nameofuser_ed25519.pub
scp ~/.ssh/keyid.pub username@server:~/nameofuser_rsa.pub

```

## Step 4: Add the public key to the server

``` sh
cat ~/nameofuser_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Step 5: Change the permissions of the authorized_keys file

```sh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Step 6: Remove the public key file from the home directory

```sh
rm ~/nameofuser_ed25519.pub
```
## Step 7: change sshd_config

```sh
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
sshd_config:

```sh
Port change it
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile    .ssh/authorized_keys
PermitRootLogin no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
AuthenticationMethods publickey, keyboard-interactive
UsePam yes
```

if there is Include path like(Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf)
check the path to the config and remove any contradiction

```sh
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
```

## Step 7: Install UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

```sh
sudo apt install ufw
```
check if it's correctly installed 

```sh
ufw version
```
or

```sh
sudo ufw version
```
## Step 8: Setup UFW

ssh = The SSH port previously configured
ports = Ports you need to be opend in your machine

```sh
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw limit ssh
sudo ufw allow ports
sudo ufw enable
```

## Step 9: Start and Check status UFW

```sh
sudo systemctl start ufw
sudo systemctl status ufw
```
## Step 10: Install google authenticator

```sh
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
```

## Step 11: Configure Google Authenticator

```sh
sudo google-authenticator
```
### Follow the instructions:

Scan the QR code with a TOTP app like Google Authenticator, Authy, or similar.
Answer the questions to configure the behavior (e.g., if you want to allow multiple codes in case of time synchronization issues).

### Check file /etc/pam.d/sshd

```sh
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd
```

sshd: 

```sh
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```
## Step 12: Restart SSH service

```sh
sudo systemctl restart sshd
sudo systemctl status sshd
```
or

```sh
sudo systemctl restart ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

## Step 13: Test SSH connection with Google Authenticator

```sh
ssh -p Port user@hostname
```

## Thank you for visiting!

I hope this helped you
